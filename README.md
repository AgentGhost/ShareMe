# Explanatory notes

<p align="left">
  To get sure to have the actual version of ShareMe, just reload the page in the desktop app on your device. <br>
  <br>
  You can search for songs by title or alternativly add a song from a specific book or list by typing in the placeholder for that database together with the number of the song. <br>
  'g' means 'green book' = Ich will dir danken (Iwdd) <br>
  'b' means 'blue book' = Loben <br>
  'p' means 'powerpoint song' (church related) <br>
  <br>
  You can always change the internal data by editing Contents.ts and subscripts in /src/app/contents to your preferences.
